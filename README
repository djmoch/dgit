Djmoch's Git Viewer
===================

DGit is designed to be a stripped down, fast Git viewer written in
pure Go. Being written in pure Go, it is possible to statically-link
the resulting command-line interface. When this is achieved, its only
external requirements are the Git repositories themselves and any
custom templates. This makes DGit suitable for dropping into a chroot
or other restricted environment.

HTTP Handler
------------

This module is imported as djmo.ch/dgit and provides a Go http.Handler
called DGit. Drop this Handler into your site's http.ServeMux and
start viewing Git repositories.

Full documentation can be found by running "go doc -all ." from this
directory.

Command-Line Interface
----------------------

The easiest way to install the DGit CLI is with "go install
djmo.ch/dgit/cmd/dgit@latest". From here, the server can be run as:

    $ dgit serve http://localhost:8080

An FCGI mode is also supported whenever a UNIX socket is provided:

    $ dgit serve unix:/run/dgit/server.sock

Full documentation can be found by running "go doc ./cmd/dgit" from
this directory.
