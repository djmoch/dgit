Djmoch's Git Viewer
===================

DGit is a fast, template-driven Git repository viewer
written in pure Go. Being written in pure Go, it is possible to
statically-link the resulting command-line interface with all of its
dependencies, including templates and static files. When this is
achieved, its only external requirements are the Git repositories
themselves. This makes DGit suitable for dropping into a chroot or
other restricted environment.

HTTP Handler
------------

This Go http.Hanlder module is imported as djmo.ch/dgit.

To use, initialize DGit with a config.Config object specifying, among
other things, an io/fs.FS containing your HTML templates, drop this
Handler into your site's http.ServeMux and start viewing Git
repositories.

The DGit handler supports the ["dumb" Git HTTP transfer protocol], so
read-only repository operations, such as cloning and fetching, are
supported.

CLI Reference Implementation
----------------------------

The command line interface (CLI) in this repository is a reference
implementation and, as such, is not suitable for general use. It does,
however, run the maintainer's Git website
(https://git.danielmoch.com). It has been made publicly available to
demonstrate how to incorporate DGit into your website.
